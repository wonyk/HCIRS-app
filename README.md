# HCIRS APP - Open House

HCIRS App is a self-developed app done by a student from Hwa Chong Institution. It utilises the framework of [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/), specifically version 1, to perform speed app development.

This [`HCIRS-app`](https://github.com/wonyk/HCIRS-app) repo is where we do development and there are many ways you can participate in the project, for example:

* [Submit bugs and feature requests](https://github.com/wonyk/HCIRS-app/issues)
* Review the code and make [pull requests](https://github.com/wonyk/HCIRS-app/pulls) for anything from typos to new content
* Spread the word about this project and use it for future events apart from open house

## Downloads

This list contains the source for downloading the various apps as a preview

Quoted from Ionic website:
> For Ionic 1x, that means UIWebView for iOS 7+, and Android 4.1 and up.

ios is not available as I do not have an apple developer account... However, HCIRS used to have subscribed. You can try your luck.
