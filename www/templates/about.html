        <h2 class="white">App rationale</h2>
        <h4 class="white">
            Made this app for fun and to test out with the usage of beacons that you will be experiencing using the TOUR GUIDE tool.
            Also note that if you are looking through this on the day of the Open House and are looking for something, the
            thing you need is after the hash without the fullstop #Kn0wL3dg3-15-K1NG. I hope the next few batch can improve
            on this to make it even better, possibly coding natively in Java (Crazy) or try IONIC.
